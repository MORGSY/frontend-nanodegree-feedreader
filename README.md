## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development." This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!

## What I learned during this project.
During the course. We dove into Testing and how to use Jasmine. My task was to build a test suite to test a Feed Reader App coded in JavaScript. The starter code was provided by Udacity and I had to build tests in Jasmine to check the Feed Reader. Some of these tests included are:

- A test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty

- Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default

- Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations:  does the menu display itself when clicked, and does it hide when clicked again?
